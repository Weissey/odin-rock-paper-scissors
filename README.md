Being my first JS project on TOP, this was a challenging task to handle at first.

I didn't quite really grasp the full understanding of functions yet, but this project solidified quite a bit of knowledge on them. I didn't use pseudo code, and suffered from code inefficiency and a lack of direction as a result. My playRound function had to be completely wiped and redone, as it wasn't working properly in the first instance, this is directly a result of poor planning and execution.

Newly learned JS:
- How to make a user prompted input all lowercase, and setup a case-insensitive system
- How to assign a function value as an argument in other another function's parameter
- How to use Math.floor and Math.random to generate values and associate them with an autonomous choice
- How using an if statement with nested if statements were a better alternative than an if statement with && operators, which didn't work correctly
- How to use increments within an if statement to keep score, and then using a return statement to output a message and to exit the if statement
- How to get new inputs from the user with repeated prompts
- How to use console.log to correctly output return statements from functions, instead of the raw code
- How to use concatenation with strings and variables within a function, then later using console.log on the function to display the results
